    <p>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio website! Here you’ll find my resume, coding projects, writing pieces, and my aspirations. (Note: some links are still under construction!) I encourage you to explore the work I have done and learn who I really am. If you want to know a little bit more about who I am, keep reading!</p>

    <p>First, I am a hardcore <i>Star Trek</i> fan. I’ve seen almost all episodes from every series and almost every movie. Don’t believe me? Here is a photo of me sitting in the captain’s seat at Trekonderoga. I’m also a fan of <i>Avatar: The Last Air Bender</i>, <i>Legend of Korra</i>, and even <i>Xena: Warrior Princess</i>. My go to music preferences are musicals and acapella. If I’m not jamming out to <i>Hamilton</i> or <i>Dear Evan Hansen</i>, I’m most certainly listening to the Nor’easters or Pentatonix.</p>
    <p>Besides movies and musicals, I’m also a gamer (hence being Head Coach of the Varsity Overwatch team at Champlain College Esports) and an avid reader. Although I really do enjoy the field of Data Analytics, I have a secret hope that one day I will be a world-famous writer.</p>
